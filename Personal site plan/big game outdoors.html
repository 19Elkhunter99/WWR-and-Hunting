            These are the kinds of animals that you can hunt. There are rules the kind of animals that you can hunt. It
            varies on the season and the population. The first thing hunters must do is to get a hunter's license. They
            can do that by taking hunter's ed. It is cheaper to take it throught their home state because they require a
            driver's license ID to ensure their residency. To hunt in other states, you must have a hunter's license to
            have ensure legal rights under the state's big game rules. After having a hunter's license, the next thing
            you mist do is draw a tag. It is always important to read regulation rules by season because the regulations
            may show that the season shows as either bow-hunting or rifle-action. Residents hunting in their home state
            can draw tags for a cheaper price. It is more expensive drawing tags outside of the state. After drawing a
            tag, you fill out a form and state how long the hunting trip will last, so the wildlife rangers are aware,
            if you encounter them. There is a heavy fine if you get caught without a license and a tag. Please be
            mindful of the rules and regulations as seen in the websites below.
