            These are the kinds of animals that you can hunt. There are rules the kind of animals that you can hunt. It
            varies on the season and the population. The first thing hunters must do is to get a hunter's license. They
            can do that by taking hunter's ed. It is cheaper to take it throught their home state because they require a
            driver's license ID to ensure their residency. To hunt in other states, you must have a hunter's license to
            have ensure legal rights under the state's big game rules. After having a hunter's license, the next thing
            you must do is draw a tag. It is always important to read regulation rules by season because the regulations
            may show that the season shows as either bow-hunting or rifle-action. Residents hunting in their home state
            can draw tags for a cheaper price. It is more expensive drawing tags outside of the state. After drawing a
            tag, you fill out a form and state how long the hunting trip will last, so the wildlife rangers are aware,
            if you encounter them. There is a heavy fine if you get caught without a license and a tag. Please be
            mindful of the rules and regulations as seen in the websites below.

            The images below show an example of what is private because there will be sign that says, “no trespassing.”
            There is a fine if you trespass into someone else’s property. This is where onXhunt maps come into play. The
            app has features that will help the user to see if the properties are BLM or private. It will also give land
            elevation details pertaining the difficulties of the land-layout. The best thing on top of knowing the
            layout of the land is knowing how much wildlife has been spotted in those areas. Some hunting map apps will
            show the color-scheme, representing how much wildlife there is. If the rating shows as green, it means that
            there has been a lot of wildlife seen in those areas. Orange to red will show that there has not been enough
            wildlife in the surrounding areas. It is always important to pay attention to the types of land that you
            have legal access to. The only way to have access to private property is to talk to the owner for permission
            to be on their property. Give this app a shot. It is really helpful whenever it comes to figuring out where
            to go.

            The best thing about hunting is being able to pick out your hunting gear and weapon. Keep in mind that it is
            always important to pay attention to the season because it may either be bow-hunting or rifle. To buy
            hunting gear, you can go to any local store that sells equipment. Some people like to go to places, such as
            Cal-Ranch and Cabela’s because of the high-quality gear they sell in stock. To buy a rifle, workers will ask
            for ID to ensure US residency. Some stores will also require both US ID, and a hunter’s license. The reason
            why they do that is to ensure that the individual knows gun safety. Uniform is number one because it keeps
            you hidden from wildlife. A smart hunter would cloak himself. The hard part is having to wear a highly
            visible vest, shirt, and a hat. This is to ensure that there are other hunters around, so no one gets
            killed. To learn about gun and bow safety, go to Hunter’s ed course for your home state to take the course
            and that is how you will get a license if you pass. There will be an exam to take after the course.
