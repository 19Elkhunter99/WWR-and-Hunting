    <h1>Are hunters allowed to hunt all kinds of animals?</h1>
    <p>The answer is no! There are certain kinds of animals that you are allowed to hunt based off the population. Keep
        in mind that it is important to pay attention to the big game rules for each state. Every state is different
        with their rules. Other states' own website will tell you what animals are limited to hunt and its perspective
        correspondance season. If you want to hunt animals, must have a license or otherwise, big game rangers will
        report you an you will have a fine against your record. If you commit any acts of felony on big game outside the
        seaon or without drawing a tag, you will be reported and be registered as a poacher. Local state can report
        poachers nationwide so otehr states know who is banned from hunting. It should be very easy. Just pay attention
        to the rules and regulations. Please be respectful of the Regulations.

    <h1>What do you do after you kill your animal?</h1>
    <p>
        Remember, shooting big game animals are just the beginning. After shooting big game critters, you still need to
        track it down to
        ensure the kill and find the carcass. To do that, you will need to follow blood trails to find them. Then you
        must drag it out of the forest and get it processed. Whether
        you’re taking it to the butcher or the taxidermist, the real work comes after you shoot the animal.
        While some hunters take pride in packing out their own kills, you don’t have to be stuck with all that hard work
        after the thrill. When you book a guided hunt, like the big game
        packages you can get at West Canyon Ranch, they take care of transporting your kill for you.

    <h1>What happens if you shoot the wrong animal by accident?</h1>
    <p>
        If a hunter accidentally kills the wrong animal, the consequences can vary depending on the circumstances and
        the
        laws of the region where the hunting took place. Generally, the hunter is expected to report the incident to
        local wildlife authorities immediately.
        An impatient hunter who fails to make sure his target is clear could also unintentionally kill two big game
        animals with one rifle shot. Failure to report an accident like that can lead to poaching charges that carry severe
        penalties.
