    <h1>How do you tell the difference between private or public property?</h1>
    <p>
        Public property is owned collectively by the state or community for use, while private property is owned
        by individuals. While they might seem self-explanatory, the differences between public and private property are
        significant and have profound implications for individuals, communities, and nations.

    <h1>How do you know when you crossed into private property?</h1>
    <p> You will see a sign that says private and you will possibly see a fence. If you want to go hunting in private
        property, you will have to get permission from the property owner. There is a fine for trespassing into private
        property. Make sure you read the rules and regulations.
