    <h1 class="question">Is Salmon River the only place to go rafting at?</h1>
    <p>Salmon River is not the only place you can go rafting in Idaho. There are lots of other places to go to. You can
        also go rafting in the snake river. Some people will go out to Ririe or the Palisades. There are a lot fun
        places to raft at. I have also heard of places in Raft River, Idaho to go to as well. You can go out the link to
        see the map of where you can go whitewater rafting in <a href="https://raftidaho.org/"> Idaho.</a> The map will
        guide you to your destination route. It is definitely worth the time and travel to go. The outdoors is the best
        part because you get to see the nature and it is beautiful. </p>
    <h1 class="question">When is the best time to go to rafting?</h1>
    <p>The best time to go rafting is when the temperature is warm. You can honestly go rafting anytime, but keep in
        mind that you are doing this activity at your own risk. Depending on the day and time, you get to see the
        wildlife. They are amazing. They are a site to see, so I highly suggest taking the time to plan and see what
        fits your comfort level.</p>
    <h1 class="question">What is the cost of whitewater rafting?</h1>
    <p>The cost various on the equipment and we do ask that costumers sign a waiver and a consent form for safety
        reasons. The cost of renting out a set is $75 per raft with oars. We also charge for life jackets, googles, etc.
        They are much cheaper. We also charge for damaged and lost equipment, so dont lose or break anything.  </p>
